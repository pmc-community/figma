/* CUSTOMISE BOOTSTRAP5
 * Is a better option to customise bootstrap in this way instead of importing sass and changing globals.
 * This way the output is much lighter, otherwise will be around 300k added to the bundle output.
 * The max size of all figma plugin files must not exceed 15MB, so is a good thing to spare as much as possible
