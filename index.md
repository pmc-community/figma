Full support for mult-pages and multi-component. It is not a react app, it allows to embedd react components anywhere in the plugin pages. It also has full support for React Redux, including the whole boilerplate code. In short, you can build very complex things without being concerned about the framework and being focused on what you want to achieve.</p>

We also develop very complex sites on HubSpot CMS so, it was a natural thing to try to make our life easier ... and to connect Figma design with HubSpot CMS for sending assets and (as much as possible, to generate pages). We work on a Figma plugin to do the job ... still work in progress. However, when will be ready, we will share it. Meanwhile you can check what we can do in HubSpot.</p>

It has Bootstrap5 support, but any css library can be used.</p>
