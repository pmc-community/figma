    When loading inline external content, the placeholder must be defined in the main md file 
    which can be a site page or a partial. The id of the partial must be passed as the last
    parameter to the getExternalMDContent(...), see on the bottom of this file.
--->
<div id="test_inline_external_content"></div>

<!--- Markdown comment -->
using site vars: {{ site.siteVars.siteTestBadge }}

```
Markdown content generated from one part of another site page
```
<!--- Include only part from another md file using a "function" from another liquid file-->
{% assign file = "intro.md" %}
{% capture included_content %}
    {% include_relative {{ file }} %}
{% endcapture %}

{% include siteIncludes/utilities.liquid fileContent=included_content %}
{{ file_content_result }}

```
Markdown content generated from one part a partial which is not a site page
```
<!--- Include part from a partial which is not processed as a page and does not appear in the left sidebar -->
{% assign file = "partials/part1.md" %}
{% capture included_content %}
    {% include_relative partials/part1.md %}
{% endcapture %}
{% include siteIncludes/utilities.liquid fileContent=included_content %}
{{ file_content_result }}

<!--- Include content from a partial which is loaded from an external file (i.e. md file from another public repo+branch)
    
    IMPORTANT!!!
    - THIS CONTENT WILL NOT RETURN ANY RESULT IN ALGOLIA OR SITE SEARCH SINCE IS GENERATED ON CLIENT SIDE
    - UPDATING ALGOLIA INSTANT SEARCH IS NOT POSSIBLE SINCE WE CANNOT MAKE BACKEND CALLS FROM GITHUB PAGES, FRONTEND CALLS MEANS EXPOSING ALGOLIA WRITE KEY
